Join us on **Saturday, 29th October 2016 at 12.00AM**, for the first MaltaJS talk.

We will talk about [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), a new functional language which compiles to Javascript and
enforces immutability and single source of truth.

One of the advantages is that within the Elm code **run-time exceptions are virtually impossible**: the compiler 
prevents the developer from using the wrong types, keys and values of the records are checked at compile time, every value is immutable
 and use of side-effects is strictly supervised.

Furthermore, it forces the developer to design the application in terms of one centralized state which reacts to messages, the so called
 [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial).

The [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux#thanks) project was actually inspired also by the Elm Architecture.
